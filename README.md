## Architecture

- built on [rails-api](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api)
- uses [grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape)
- api docs generated using [grape-swagger](https://github.com/tim-vandecasteele/grape-swagger)

## Configuration

Modify the `default_url_options` in the various environment files as appropriate.
